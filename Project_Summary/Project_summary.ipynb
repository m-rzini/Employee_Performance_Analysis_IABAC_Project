    "\n",
    "#### __Dataset Description__\n",
    "- The information utilized in this project originates from the dataset offered by IABAC for an imaginary company named INC Future Inc. Within this dataset, there is a collection of employee profiles encompassing diverse features, including both categorical and numerical attributes. The primary objective is to forecast the performance rating of employees based on the provided feature values.\n",
    " - You can access the dataset from here -> http://data.iabac.org/exam/p2/data/INX_Future_Inc_Employee_Performance_CDS_Project2_Data_V1.8.xls\n",
    " - No external data is needed for the purpose of this project\n",
    " - The data set contains ordinal, nominal and numerical values as features and the target variable i.e Performance rating is again an ordinal variable.\n",
    "#### __The following are the project goals:__\n",
    "    1. Department wise performance \n",
    "    2. Three most important features \n",
    "    3. A trained machine learning model to predict the target variable\n",
    "    4. Recommandations to imporve employee performance based on analysis and inferences\n",
    "- The data set is a structured labelled dataset containing 1200 records and 27 features and a target variable in total\n",
    "- Feature count suggests that 11 of these features are quantitative and 16 of these features are qualitative features\n",
    "#### __Analysis techniques used:__\n",
    "    - Distribution analysis - pandas and kernal density estimate plots\n",
    "    - Correlation analysis - heatmaps\n",
    "    - Analysis by visualization - univariate analysis using pandas yprofiling and bivariate analysis\n",
    "#### __Data Processing:__\n",
    "    - One hot encoding has been performed on the categorical  features using pandas get_dummies() method\n",
    "    - The dataset was imbalanced as seen from the value_counts() of the target variable \n",
    "    - A combination of SMOTE and RandomUnderSampling has been used to give a better balanced dataset without falling into the traps or cons of simpling over sampling or undersampling the data\n",
    "    - Feature and target splits have been performed by using pandas .iloc for data slicing\n",
    "    - Training and validation split were preformed usign sklearn's train_test_split\n",
    "#### __Machine learning:__\n",
    "    - After preprocessing the data the cross validation has been performed on each of the supervised machine learning algorithms namely Logistic regression, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Classifier, XGBoostClassifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours and an unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-means clustering. The validation score evidently gave out __GradientBoostingClassifier__ and __XGBClassifier__ to be the best performing algorithms\n",
    "    - Hyperparmeter tuning was done on both of the above chosen ML models using RandomizedSearchCV and an accuracy of 91% was achieved although a higher compute using GridSearchCV would give much better results for future reference\n",
    "#### __Important Features:__\n",
    "    - The top three important features were chosen by using RandomForestClassifier and train the model and then using its .feature_importance_ attribute once the model has been trained to gather insight on which features have the highest predictive value\n",

    "1. The better the employee's worklife balance the better he/she performs\n",
    "2. Trainings should be kept at a moderate amount as a very high amount of training is resulting in reducing employee performance\n",
    "3. The Employee relationship should be kept in control and not very low or very high as that affects the performance rating of the employee\n",
    "4. The higher the environment satisfaction the higher is the employee performance \n",

    "3. There is also a considerable correlation between ExperienceYearsAtThisCompany and YearsSinceLastPromotion (__0.62%__) although from the subsequent heatmaps and Line Charts is clear that someone with experience higher than 35 years with this company or someone as new as having less than 15 years with this company is likely to get a promotion as compared to someone who has been associated with the company for more than 20 or less than 35 years.\n",

    "- Enhancing the work environment is paramount for fostering greater employee satisfaction. This crucial factor consistently emerges as the most pivotal element in all analyses, promising substantial enhancements in overall employee performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Regularly reassessing roles, perhaps every couple of years, is a proven strategy to elevate employee performance. This approach ensures that job roles stay dynamic and aligned with evolving skills and organizational needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gender diversity can be leveraged to boost Human Resources performance by actively recruiting more female employees. Analysis indicates that female HR professionals tend to exhibit notably superior performance, offering a valuable avenue for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strategic restructuring of the work environment, along with periodic role and salary revisions, should prioritize the finance department. Given its higher proportion of underperforming employees, this targeted approach aims to address and improve performance disparities within the department."
