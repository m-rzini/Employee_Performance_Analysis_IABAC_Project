    "3. There is also a considerable correlation between ExperienceYearsAtThisCompany and YearsSinceLastPromotion (__0.62%__) although from the subsequent heatmaps and Line Charts is clear that someone with experience higher than 35 years with this company or someone as new as having less than 15 years with this company is likely to get a promotion as compared to someone who has been associated with the company for more than 20 or less than 35 years.\n",
